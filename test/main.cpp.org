This comment is not only a C++ comment since it has the starting and ending
delimiters of a C-style C++ comment, but because of the extra characters at
the end of the starting delimiter it also will be recognized by the doxygen
utility and given special treatment. By the way, that last (optional) <
character at the end of the opening delimiter is critical if you want to place
the doxygen comment *after* the thing you are documenting. If that final < is
missing, the comment is interpreted as coming before the thing being documented.
